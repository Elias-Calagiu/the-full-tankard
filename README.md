# THE FULL TANKARD


## DESCRIPTION
Introducing "The Full Tankard", an streamlined web application, allows bar managers to find information about local beers and breweries in Washington State.

---------
## USER STORY
Bar managers have to make purchasing decisions, sometimes on the fly, sometimes mapped out weeks or months in advance. As such, they need access to information about the available offerings from local breweries.   

AS A bar manager
I WANT to search for beers by name, style, ABV, or characteristics in description
SO THAT I can locate and procure local beers that my customers will enjoy or have enjoyed.

Also, AS A bar manager,
I WANT a directory of brewers by name with styles of beer brewed and contact information
SO THAT I can locate and procure local beers from brewers that my customers might enjoy at my bar.
